AutoEDA is an open-source Python application designed to streamline the process of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and modeling using Machine Learning Algorithms for data scientists, analysts, and anyone working with data. EDA is a crucial step in understanding your dataset, finding patterns, and preparing data for further analysis. AutoML simplifies this process by providing an interactive web-based platform to explore, visualize, and preprocess and model your data effortlessly.


## Key Features

- Interactive Data Exploration: Upload datasets, view data statistics, and visualize features through an intuitive Streamlit interface.

- Automated Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess data with options to handle missing values, remove unwanted columns, and apply one-hot encoding.

- AutoML Model Training: Automatically train and evaluate machine learning models with PyCaret for regression or classification tasks.

- Data Profiling and Reporting: Generate and download comprehensive data profile reports using Pandas Profiling for detailed insights.
